This WordPress plugin enhances website security by preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It blocks and encodes malicious characters in URLs, escapes HTML in `$_GET` variables, and provides customizable settings for website owners.

== Description ==

This plugin helps safeguard your website against two common types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:

* **Reflected XSS:** In Reflected XSS, malicious scripts are injected into the URL of a website. When a user clicks on a link containing this malicious script, it can be executed on their browser, potentially stealing their information or compromising their system.
* **Self-XSS:** This occurs when a user's own input on the website is reflected back to them in an insecure manner, allowing malicious scripts to be executed in their browser.

This plugin provides several layers of protection:

**Blocking:** When enabled, the plugin scans URLs for specific parameters. If any of the listed parameters are found in the URL, the plugin redirects the user to prevent potential XSS attacks. You can customize the list by excluding specific parameters you still want to allow.

* Opening Round Bracket `(`
* Closing Round Bracket `)`
* Less than Sign `<`
* Greater than Sign `>`
* Opening Square Bracket `[`
* Closing Square Bracket `]`
* Opening Curly Bracket `{`
* Pipe or Vertical Bar `|`
* Closing Curly Bracket `}`

**Encoding:** For additional security, the plugin encodes certain characters within the URL parameters. This prevents malicious code from being executed even if it's included in the URL. You can also exclude specific parameters from being encoded.

* Exclamation Mark `!`
* Double Quotation `"`
* Single Quotation `'`
* Opening Round Bracket `(`
* Closing Round Bracket `)`
* Asterisk Sign `*`
* Less than Sign `<`
* Greater than Sign `>`
* Grave Accent <code>`</code>
* Cap Sign `^`
* Opening Square Bracket `[`
* Closing Square Bracket `]`
* Opening Curly Bracket `{`
* Pipe or Vertical Bar `|`
* Closing Curly Bracket `}`

**Escaping HTML in `$_GET`:** This plugin automatically escapes HTML characters within the `$_GET` variable. This is crucial if your website retrieves data from URLs and displays it in the HTML content. This helps prevent malicious scripts from being injected through user-controlled input.
